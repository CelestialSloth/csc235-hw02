# Reflection
## Individual Contributions
### Liberty
* Created the Sunday Brush visualization
* Created the Message Density visualization
* Created the Message Location visualization
* Wrote report draft
* Drew sketches for message frequency

### Elaine
* Worked with Emi to create the Movement Density visualization
* Made minor edits to Message Location visualization (alter colors and labels)
* Wrote the readme
* Wrote code to generate a spreadsheet organizing movement data by id, which we didn't end up using
* Updated the report with findings that occurred after Thursday

### Emi
* Worked with Elaine to create the Movement Density visualization
* Discovered the reporting line number
* Pursued a few small hypotheses that didn’t come to fruition (also spent a lot of time thinking up algorithms that we couldn’t use, even if I didn’t code them). Came up with a few other visualizations that would have taken too long to code.
* Created sketches for movement density and pie chart 
* Contributed to report draft finalization process
* Fixed/identified small mistakes in a variety of places

## Obstacle
An obstacle we encountered this week was difficulty finding time together to work due to packed schedules. We ended up splitting off to work on different aspects of the assignment, and requested an extension so we could focus on the project more after other major deadlines of the week had passed.

## If we were to do the assignment again
* If we were to do this assignment again with more time: Pursue more avenues of looking for patterns within the movement data to identify groups that could be responsible. A more efficient way of combining the movement and message data to better identify groups and individual/group timelines 
* If we were to do this again with the same amount of time: agree on goals and roles earlier on and be more thoughtful about dividing work evenly/efficiently.
