# How to generate visualizations
## Message Density
This visualization compares the number of messages sent at different times of day for each of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. To generate, run all code blocks in ```message_density.ipynb``` and observe the visualization produced in the final code block.

## Message Density for the Report Number
We hypothesize that 839736 is the suspicious incident report line. Similar to the previous visualization, this visualization compares the number of messages sent to 839736 at different times of day for each of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  To generate, run all code blocks in ```message_density_report_number.ipynb``` and observe the visualization produced in the final code block.

## Message Locations
This visualization compares the number of messages sent at different times of day during midday Sunday, when we hypothesize the crime occurred. To generate, run all code blocks in ```messages_location.ipynb``` and observe the visualization produced in the final code block.

## Sunday Brush
This visualization allows you to zoom into the message frequency at any time on Sunday, the day we hypothesize the crime occurred.  To generate, run all code blocks in ```sunday_brush.ipynb``` and observe the visualization produced in the final code block.

## Movement Density
This visualization compares the number of people in different locations of the park on Sunday. Use the scrubber to check different times.  To generate, run all code blocks in ```movement_density.ipynb``` and observe the visualization produced in the final code block.

## Top Message Receivers around Noon in the Wetlands
This visualization is a pie chart that shows the top message recipients in the Wet Lands around noon on Sunday. To generate, run all code blocks in ```message_pie_chart.ipynb``` and observe the visualization produced in the final code block.
